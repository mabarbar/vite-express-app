# Install

To make everything work you need to perform `npm i` in both `backend` and `frontend` directories.

Next create `.env` file and add variables to it based on `.env.template`.

To make app work, set `PORT=4000` and `MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://admin:123@cluster0.njlzfwr.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&`

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

-   [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
-   [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
